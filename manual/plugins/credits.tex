\subsection{Credits}
The credits plugin scrolls the entire list of the names of all the Rockbox
contributors after displaying the Rockbox logo and version. This plugin is
called when selecting \setting{Version} from the \setting{System} section of
the Rockbox main menu. Exit at any time by pressing \ActionStdCancel.
