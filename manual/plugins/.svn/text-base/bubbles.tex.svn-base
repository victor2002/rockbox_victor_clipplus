\subsection{Bubbles}

The goal of the game is to beat each level as quickly as possible by clearing
the board of all bubbles. Bubbles are removed from the board when a cluster of
three of more of the same type is formed. The game is over when any bubbles on
the board extend below the bottom line. To make things more difficult, the
entire board is shifted down every time a certain number of shots have been
fired. Points are awarded depending on how quickly the level was completed.
