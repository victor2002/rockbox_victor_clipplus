\section{\label{ref:StartupShutdownOptions}Startup/Shutdown}

The \setting{Startup/Shutdown} sub menu allows you to configure items which
are run at startup, or initiate a shutdown when conditions are met.

\subsection{Start Screen}
  Set the screen that Rockbox will start in. The default is the main menu but
  the following options are available:
  % almost all items in the main menu with a few exceptions
  \begin{description}
    \item[Previous Screen.] Start Rockbox in the same screen as when it was
    shut off.
    \item[Main Menu.] Show the main menu.
    \item[Files.] Display the file browser, starting in the root directory of
    your \dap.
    \item[Database.] Show the default database view.
    \item[Resume Playback.] Go to the WPS and and resume playback from where
    it was before turning off (if there is a playlist to resume).
    \item[Settings.] Display the main settings menu.
    \opt{recording}{

      (recording does not start automatically).
    }

  \end{description}

\subsection{\label{ref:IdlePoweroffSetting}Idle Poweroff}
  Rockbox can be configured to turn off power after the unit has been idle for
  a defined number of minutes. The \dap{} is idle when playback is stopped or
  paused. It is not idle while the USB or charger is connected
  \opt{recording}{, or while recording}.
  Settings are either \setting{Off} or 1 to 10 minutes in 1 minute steps. Then
  15, 30, 45 or 60 minutes are available.

\subsection{Sleep Timer}
  The \setting{Sleep Timer} powers off your \dap{} after a given time, whether
  playing or not.
  \begin{description}
    \item[Sleep Timer:]
      Shown when the \setting{Sleep Timer} is inactive, it can be set from
      \setting{Off} to 5 hours in 5 minute steps.
      While the \setting{Sleep Timer} is reset on boot, the value selected is
      retained and will be used as the default from then on.
    \item[Cancel Sleep Timer (h:mm):]
      Shown when the \setting{Sleep Timer} is active, this option disables the
      current \setting{Sleep Timer}.
    \item[Start Sleep Timer On Boot:]
      If set, a \setting{Sleep Timer} will be initiated when the device
      starts.
    \item[Restart Sleep Timer On Keypress:]
      If set, when a \setting{Sleep Timer} is active and a key is pressed, the
      \setting{Sleep Timer} will be restarted with the initial duration.
